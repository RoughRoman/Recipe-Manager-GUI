3 base classes: ingredient, recipe, and RecipeManager.
Ingredient holds ingredient data.

recipe contains ingredients and further recipe data

RecipeManager manages a list of recipes

The qt Classes are fairly self explanatory with mainwindow interacting with an instance of recipe manager
aswell as displaying individual recipe data

Some dialogs for user input and warnings
Very simple, very stupid.

Could it be better? Definetly.
